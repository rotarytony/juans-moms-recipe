# SPICY CUCUMBER KIMCHI

## Ingredients:

- 1 English cucumber (Persian or mini cucumbers can be used)
- 1 teaspoon Kosher salt
- 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
- 2 tablespoons gochugaru (coarse), also known as Korean red pepper flakes
- 1 tablespoon granulated sugar
- 1 tablespoon fish sauce or soy sauce
- 1 clove garlic, minced or grated (about ½ tablespoon per clove)
- ½ tablespoon toasted sesame oil (optional)

## Procedure:

1. Cut the cucumber into ¼-inch coins, discarding the ends. Place them in a bowl and sprinkle with Kosher salt. Mix well and set aside for 10 to 15 minutes until the cucumber coins become flexible, and a small pool of liquid collects at the bottom of the bowl.

2. While the cucumbers are salting, prepare the marinade by combining rice vinegar, gochugaru, sugar, fish sauce, minced or grated garlic, and sesame oil (if using) in a large bowl. Set the marinade aside.

3. Once the cucumber coins have finished salting, rinse them with cold water several times to remove excess salt. Drain well.

4. Add the cucumber coins to the bowl of prepared marinade. Mix until everything is evenly coated.

5. Enjoy immediately or refrigerate for 30 minutes to overnight before serving.
